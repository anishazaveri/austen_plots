## Introduction
This repository contains demo data and code for

If a common cause affects both a treatment and outcome it can induce a spurious correlation. 
For example, the wealth of a patient influences both their health outcomes and whether they take an expensive drug.
The presence of the common cause (wealth) induces a spurious positive association between the drug and the outcome.
Austen plots are a simple visual method of determining whether some unobserved common could explain away the association between a specified treatment and outcome. The included software produces Austen plots from the outputs of standard data modeling used in causal inference pipelines.
